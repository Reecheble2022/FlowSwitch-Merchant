# ADR-0001: Use Supabase for Backend

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** ✅ Accepted
**Deciders:** Engineering Team, CTO
**Tags:** `backend`, `database`, `auth`, `infrastructure`

---

## Context

FlowSwitch requires a robust backend solution for:
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data (agents, merchants, transactions)
- **Authentication:** User login, JWT management, session handling
- **Storage:** File uploads (verification photos, documents)
- **Real-time:** Live updates for dashboard KPIs and notifications

### Requirements

| Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Must-have | ACID compliance, mature, JSON support |
| **Row Level Security (RLS)** | Must-have | Security enforced at DB level |
| **Authentication** | Must-have | Email/password, JWT tokens |
| **File Storage** | Must-have | Profile photos, verification docs |
| **Real-time Updates** | Nice-to-have | Dashboard live refresh |
| **Low Ops Overhead** | Must-have | Small team, no dedicated DevOps |
| **Cost-Effective** | Must-have | Free tier for MVP, scalable pricing |

### Constraints

- **Team:** 2 engineers, no dedicated DevOps
- **Budget:** $0 for MVP, <$100/month for production
- **Timeline:** 8 weeks to MVP
- **Compliance:** GDPR, POPIA (data protection regulations)

---

## Decision

**We will use Supabase** as our backend platform, providing:
1. Managed PostgreSQL database with automatic backups
2. Row Level Security (RLS) enforced at database level
3. Authentication via Supabase Auth (JWT-based)
4. File storage with S3-compatible API
5. Real-time subscriptions via WebSockets
6. Generous free tier (500MB DB, 1GB storage, 50K MAU)

---

## Rationale

### Why Supabase?

#### 1. **Security First**

**Row Level Security (RLS) is enforced at the database level.**

```sql
-- Example: Users can only see their own agents
CREATE POLICY "users_view_own_agents"
  ON agents FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (owner_id = auth.uid());
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Impossible to bypass (enforced by PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Works with any client (web, mobile, API)
- ✅ No middleware to maintain

**Alternative approaches (e.g., Express middleware) are error-prone:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Middleware can be bypassed
app.get('/agents', authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // What if middleware is forgotten on a new endpoint?
  const agents = await db.query('SELECT * FROM agents');
  res.json(agents);
});
```

#### 2. **Developer Experience**

**Supabase provides auto-generated TypeScript types:**
```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <id> > src/types/database.ts
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Type-safe queries
- ✅ Autocomplete in IDE
- ✅ Catch errors at compile time

**Example:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Type-safe, autocomplete works
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('agents')
  .select('id, name, phone, email')
  .eq('status', 'active');

// TypeScript knows:
// - data is Agent[] | null
// - Can only filter by columns that exist
// - "status" must be valid enum value
```

#### 3. **Cost & Scalability**

**Free Tier (Forever):**
- 500MB database
- 1GB file storage
- 50,000 monthly active users
- Unlimited API requests

**Paid Tier (Pro: $25/month):**
- 8GB database
- 100GB file storage
- 100,000 monthly active users
- Daily backups (7-day retention)
- Point-in-time recovery

**Scaling path is clear:**
- Start free, upgrade when needed
- No migration required (same API)
- Horizontal scaling via read replicas

#### 4. **Time to Market**

**With Supabase, we get out-of-the-box:**
- Authentication (email/password, OAuth)
- Authorization (RLS policies)
- File storage (S3-compatible)
- Real-time subscriptions
- Auto-generated REST API
- Admin dashboard
- Monitoring & logs

**Without Supabase, we'd need to build:**
- Express server (3 days)
- Authentication system (5 days)
- File upload handling (2 days)
- RLS-like middleware (3 days)
- Real-time WebSockets (3 days)
- Admin UI (5 days)
- Monitoring setup (2 days)
- **Total: ~23 days**

**With Supabase: <1 day to set up**

#### 5. **Community & Ecosystem**

- **Open Source:** Full codebase on GitHub (23K+ stars)
- **Active Development:** Weekly releases, responsive support
- **Ecosystem:** Extensions, integrations, CLI tools
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive, well-maintained

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Firebase (Google)

**Pros:**
- Real-time by default
- Generous free tier
- Excellent mobile SDKs
- Managed infrastructure

**Cons:**
- ❌ **NoSQL only** (Firestore) - Poor fit for relational data
- ❌ **Security rules are complex** and easy to misconfigure
- ❌ **Vendor lock-in** - Migration is very difficult
- ❌ **No SQL queries** - Limited aggregations and joins

**Why Not:**
- Our data model is highly relational (agents ↔ merchants, float ↔ transactions)
- NoSQL would require complex denormalization
- Security rules are client-side and harder to audit

### Option 2: Custom Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL

**Pros:**
- Full control over infrastructure
- No vendor lock-in
- Familiar stack

**Cons:**
- ❌ **High ops overhead** - Server management, backups, monitoring
- ❌ **Slower development** - Build auth, file storage, real-time
- ❌ **Security risk** - Middleware can be bypassed, no RLS
- ❌ **Cost** - VPS ($50/month) + database ($20/month) + storage ($10/month)

**Why Not:**
- Team size (2 engineers) can't support ops burden
- Timeline (8 weeks) doesn't allow building from scratch
- Security is critical - RLS is more robust than middleware

### Option 3: Hasura + PostgreSQL

**Pros:**
- Auto-generated GraphQL API
- RLS support
- Real-time subscriptions

**Cons:**
- ❌ **No built-in auth** - Must integrate third-party (Auth0, etc.)
- ❌ **GraphQL complexity** - Overkill for this project
- ❌ **Weaker ecosystem** - Smaller community than Supabase

**Why Not:**
- GraphQL adds complexity without clear benefits
- Auth integration is extra work
- Supabase has better documentation and community

### Option 4: AWS Amplify

**Pros:**
- Full AWS ecosystem integration
- Managed services
- Enterprise-ready

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Complexity** - Steep learning curve, many services to configure
- ❌ **Cost** - Expensive at scale, hard to predict
- ❌ **Lock-in** - AWS-specific, migration difficult

**Why Not:**
- Overkill for MVP
- Too many moving parts (Cognito, AppSync, DynamoDB, S3)
- Higher cost and complexity

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Fast Development** - MVP in 8 weeks instead of 12+
2. **Lower Cost** - $0 for MVP, ~$25/month for production
3. **Better Security** - RLS enforced at DB level, hard to bypass
4. **Scalability** - Clear upgrade path, no code changes needed
5. **Less Ops** - No servers to manage, auto-backups, monitoring included

### Negative

1. **Vendor Lock-in** - Migration away from Supabase is non-trivial
   - **Mitigation:** PostgreSQL is portable, auth is the main lock-in
   - **Risk:** Low - Supabase is open-source, self-hosting is possible

2. **Client-Side API Calls** - All queries from browser (more latency)
   - **Mitigation:** RLS enforces security, caching reduces calls
   - **Risk:** Low - Acceptable for this use case

3. **Limited Customization** - Some PostgreSQL features unavailable
   - **Mitigation:** Most features we need are supported
   - **Risk:** Low - Can use RPC for custom functions if needed

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Supabase shuts down** | Low | High | Open-source, can self-host |
| **Pricing increases** | Medium | Medium | Negotiate or migrate |
| **Performance issues** | Low | High | Optimize queries, add indexes |
| **Security breach** | Low | Critical | Regular audits, RLS review |

## Review

### What Went Well

1. ✅ RLS policies prevented several security bugs
2. ✅ Auto-generated types caught TypeScript errors early
3. ✅ Free tier sufficient for MVP + first 100 customers
4. ✅ Real-time subscriptions "just worked"
5. ✅ Documentation was comprehensive and accurate

### What Could Be Improved

1. ⚠️ RLS policies are hard to debug (no error messages)
   - **Solution:** Add `RAISE NOTICE` in policies for debugging
2. ⚠️ No local development without Docker
   - **Solution:** Use Supabase CLI for local setup
3. ⚠️ File storage quotas are strict on free tier
   - **Solution:** Implement image compression

### Lessons Learned

- **Start with RLS from day 1** - Retrofitting is painful
- **Test RLS policies with multiple users** - Edge cases are subtle
- **Use Supabase CLI** - Easier than web dashboard for migrations
- **Monitor query performance** - RLS policies can be slow if not optimized
