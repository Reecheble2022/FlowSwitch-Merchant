# 🚀 Quick Share Guide

## Fastest Way to Share (5 minutes)

### Method 1: Netlify Drop (No Account Needed - 2 minutes)

1. **Already built!** Your `dist` folder is ready
2. Go to: **https://app.netlify.com/drop**
3. **Drag and drop** the `dist` folder from this project
4. **Copy the URL** that appears
5. **Share URL** with your developer

**That's it!** Your app is live and accessible.

---

### Method 2: ZIP and Email/Cloud (3 minutes)

#### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
zip -r flowswitch.zip . -x "node_modules/*" -x "dist/*" -x ".git/*"
```

#### On Windows:
1. Right-click project folder
2. "Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"

Then share via:
- Email (if < 25MB)
- Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive
- WeTransfer (for larger files)

**Your developer needs:**
1. Extract the ZIP
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Ask you for the `.env` file (contains Supabase credentials)

---

### Method 3: GitHub (Best for Collaboration)

```bash
# 1. Create a repo on GitHub (github.com/new)

# 2. Run these commands in your project:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "FlowSwitch application"
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main

# 3. Share the GitHub URL
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Don't commit the `.env` file! Send it separately (encrypted message, password manager, etc.)

## 📧 Message Template for Your Developer

```
Hi [Developer Name],

I've built the FlowSwitch application and need you to review/continue development.

🔗 Live Demo: [YOUR_NETLIFY_URL]
📦 Code: [GITHUB_URL or ZIP link]

The app is fully functional with:
✅ Agent management with CSV/XLSX export
✅ Float account management (assign, top-up, debit, ledger)
✅ Voucher system (create, redeem, print QR codes)
✅ Prompt system (send now, schedule with preview)
✅ All critical buttons operational

Tech Stack:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)

To run locally:
1. npm install
2. Add .env file (I'll send separately)
3. npm run dev

See DEPLOYMENT.md for full setup instructions.

Let me know if you need anything!
```

## 🔐 Sharing the .env File

**NEVER share .env via:**
- Public GitHub
- Unencrypted email
- Public chat

**Safe options:**
1. **Password Manager** (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
2. **Encrypted Message** (Signal, WhatsApp)
3. **Secure Note** (Google Docs with restricted access)
4. **In Person** (best for sensitive data)

Your `.env` contains:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```
